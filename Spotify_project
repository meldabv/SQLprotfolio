** For this project I gathered Spotify data from Kaggle's website to create a table and analyze it in the following described ways; **

** Find the Average danceability by artist and tracks **
SELECT artist_name, SUM(danceability)/COUNT(track_name) Avg_Dance
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name

** Find the Average danceability of Ariana Grande's tracks **
SELECT artist_name, track_name, SUM(danceability)/COUNT(track_name) Avg_Dance
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name='Ariana Grande'
ORDER BY artist_name

** Find the top ten most popular artist **
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 10

** Find the artist with the longest song **
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC LIMIT 1

** Find the average danceability of the 10 most popular songs **
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM (SELECT track_name, popularity, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY Popularity DESC LIMIT 10)
