** For this project I gathered Spotify data from Kaggle's website to create a table and analyze it in the following described ways; **

** Table created for Spotify_data **
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

** Find the Average danceability by artist and tracks **
SELECT artist_name, SUM(danceability)/COUNT(track_name) Avg_Dance
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name

** Find the Average danceability of Ariana Grande's tracks **
SELECT artist_name, track_name, SUM(danceability)/COUNT(track_name) Avg_Dance
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name='Ariana Grande'
ORDER BY artist_name

** Find the top ten most popular artist **
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 10

** Find the artist with the longest song **
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC LIMIT 1

** Find the average danceability of the 10 most popular songs **
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM (SELECT track_name, popularity, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY Popularity DESC LIMIT 10)
